<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Silky smooth roux (prounced roo) not only thickens sauces, soups, and stews,
  but it also adds a subtle nutty flavor to the dish. It's an essential building
  block of recipes ranging from macaroni and cheese to gumbo. Every cook should
  know how to make a roux, and it's easier than you might think. Let's do some
  roux!
</p>
<h2>Ingridients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 part oil or fat</li>
  <li>1 part all-purpose flour, by weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Begin by heating 2 tablespoons oil or fat in a saucepan over medium heat
    until a pinch of flour sprinkled into the oil just begins to bubble.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then, whisk in 3-1/2 tablespoons of flour to form a thick paste the
    consistency of cake frosting. 
  </li>
  <li>Continue whisking as the roux gently bubbles
    and cooks to the shade desired. Do not allow the roux to bubble too
    vigorously, or it will burn rather than brown.
  </li>
</ol>
