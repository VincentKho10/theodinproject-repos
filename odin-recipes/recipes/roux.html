        <p>
          Silky smooth roux (prounced roo) not only thickens sauces, soups, and
          stews, but it also adds a subtle nutty flavor to the dish. It's an
          essential building block of recipes ranging from macaroni and cheese
          to gumbo. Every cook should know how to make a roux, and it's easier
          than you might think. Let's do some roux!

      <h2>Ingridients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 part oil or fat</li>
        <li>1 part all-purpose flour, by weight.</li>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Begin by heating 2 tablespoons oil or fat in a saucepan over medium
          heat until a pinch of flour sprinkled into the oil just begins to
          bubble.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, whisk in 3-1/2 tablespoons of flour to form a thick paste the
          consistency of cake frosting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue whisking as the roux gently bubbles and cooks to the shade
          desired. Do not allow the roux to bubble too vigorously, or it will
          burn rather than brown.
